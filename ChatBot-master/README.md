# ChatBot
A simple ChatBot project in C#. Created by a Sophomore in High School.
Current Version: v0.1.3

This ChatBot is very early in development! Don't expect much from it!
It's not meant for a public distribution yet, but do to false positives from Crowdstrike Falcon on my device,
I must move progress over to another machine to build the executable file. 

This program was just a silly idea I had to make a ChatBot in C#. I'm still new to this, but I'm slowly learning.
I'm not using any Azure API, so anyone should be able to take and edit it. 
Enjoy if you use this!
